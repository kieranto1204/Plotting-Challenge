In order for this code to run properly, you will want to use gitbash and the command:

git clone https://github.com/kieranto1204/Plotting-Challenge.git

Make sure that you are running the code using a python terminal and that the program is not in restricted mode.

If you don't do this portion, then the file location that is specified in my files will not work.

When running the pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb file, make sure to set the kernel to your jupyter notebook link so that it runs properly.

Overview:

This challenge asked us to create several graphs using data based on mice taking several different treatments for their tumors.

This included creating:

- A bar and pie chart, using both pandas DataFrame.plot and pyplot, in my example you will see that I still used pyplot to add things like titles to my pandas plots.
- Calculating the quartiles and outliers as well as creating a box plot that had the information from 4 of the treatments.
- A line plot based around a single mouse
- A scatter plot based around all mice taking Capomulin treatments
- Calculating the correlation and regression and adding a line of regression to our scatter plot.
- 3 observations/analysis based on the information we saw.
